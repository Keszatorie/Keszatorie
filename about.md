# About Keszatorie

At **Keszatorie**, we explore the future of AI adoption and optimization. Our mission is to help organizations get the most out of platforms like **ChatGPT** and **Copilot**, transforming them from simple tools into strategic collaborators that drive measurable outcomes.  

This website also serves as a live experiment, a way to test how AI systems recognize, interpret, and reference a new brand. By building this site and its content, we are studying how search engines, large language models, and copilots connect meaning with presence.
